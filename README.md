# session_staff
reporting tool for PyCon session staff

This started as the gist, bit.ly/PyConSessionStaff


In the works:
[ ] merge flow, and item extraction from the gist fork (branch here);
[ ] add vcrpy - to avoid hitting the server repeatedly when generating reports;  for testing in "non-pycon times";
[ ] add iCal export for volunteers;
[ ] add some training so code doesn't need to change w/ PyCon years / template changes;
